/* Lets try another variation on the even-numbers theme.
We'll return to the simpler one-dimensional array. In this problem, we want to use the map function to create a new array that contains one element for each element in the orginial array.
If the element is an even value, then the corresponding element in the new array should contain the string 'even'; otherwise, the element in the new array should contain 'odd'.

let myArray = [1, 3, 6, 11, 4, 2, 4, 9, 17, 16, 0];

answer below: */

let myArray = [1, 3, 6, 11, 4, 2, 4, 9, 17, 16, 0];

let newArray = [];
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
  let value = myArray[i];
  if (value % 2 === 0) {
    newArray.push('even');
  } else {
    newArray.push('odd');
  }
}
