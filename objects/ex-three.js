/* use object literal syntax (e.g. key: value) notation) to create an object that behaves as an array in a for statement.
The object should contain at least 3 elements. You should place your code between the braces in the let statement:

let myArray = {
};

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}

hint: Arrays use positive integers starting with 0 as indexes. An array also must have a length property. 

answer below: */

let myArray = {
	0: 'a',
	1: 'b',
	2: 'c',
	length: 3,
};

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1)	{
	console.log(myArray[i]);
}
