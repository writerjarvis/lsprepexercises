Answer below:
Error happens in the exercise2.js program on the 4th line. 
The ^ points to where JS thinks the error is made in the code.
The ReferenceError tells you that the name greeting isn't defined.
The following line tells you that the error was detected at column 15 of line 4 of the program, it also tells you that the error is in the hello function.
Next line tells you that the hello was called from line 13 of the program.
